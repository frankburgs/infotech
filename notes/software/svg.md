# Notes
- Trace simpler images to convert to svg or use tools.
- Modifying width, height, and stroke may change the other values as well.
- Use units that work (px, mm...) and where text can be displayed to maintain aspect ratios.
- Go for the simplest visual interpretation with the fewest lines and build.

## Print
- Tailwind has a stroke-width utility.

## Sanitization
- Delete ?xml element before the svg element.
- Delete sodipodi:nameview element.
