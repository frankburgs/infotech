- Public (several customers), private (one), hybrid.
- IaaS, can access networking, storage, and networking space without having to operate or manage.
- PaaS, can access the specific tools on the platform.
- SaaS, software licensing and delivery model on subscription basis.
- Virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) used to access their enterprise apps.
- Community cloud is used by group(s) who want to share secrets.
- DaaS allows users to access desktops and apps from anywhere.
- DaaS is implemented using VDI.
- Linux based containers, Kubernetes, Istio, multicluster management tools, message queues, brokers.
- You can replatform an application to make it cloud native to eliminate need for virtualization.

# Types of cloud storage
- Object supports large backups, uses metadata for fast keyword search, is AI scalable, & stores log files.
- Block is fast, reliable, across environments, and updates large data amounts frequenty and supports email servers.
- File has familiar interface, subfolder management, supports ZIP and USB transfers, low scalability. File gateway is a file server in the cloud, S3, NFS, SMB.

# Cloud Services
- Infrastructure is the physical resources, as well as the virtualization (hypervisor) layer.
- Platform is more like operating system (runtime environments), high level of abstraction, middleware, includes databases, API's.
- Software is like Netsuite etc, multitenant.

- Cloud computing : Shared pool of computing resources (networks, servers, storage, applications, services).

- Storage area network (SAN) : Combines servers, storage systems, switches, software, services to provide secure, robust, data transfer.

- Network attached storage (NAS) : Local file server.

- Tape gateway : Tape cloud backups, S3, glacier, glacier deep archive.

- Total cost of ownership (TCO).

- Volume gateway : Data transfers between cloud and on-premises, iSCSI, cached (frequently used only) or stored (everything).
