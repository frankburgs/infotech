# Installation
- You can use Tailwind by saving the Javascript source file from the CDN locally and running it in your file, but this is not recommended for 'production'.
- It appears there is a different way where you can download and install something ðŸ¤”
- Most pragmatic appears to use NPM.

``` shell
npm install -D tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init
```
