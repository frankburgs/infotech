# Setup

- From scratch

``` shell
$ npm create vite # Follow cmd instructions for React option.
# Follow the TailwindCSS documentation for the Vite framework.
$ npm i react react-dom/client react-router
```

- To setup from repo

``` shell
$ git clone repoUrl.git
$ npm i
```

- The main folder has 4 config files, eslint for React/JSX ❔, postcss and tailwind, and vite.
- Since we are not too concerned for version compatibility, the gitignore includes the package-lock, as well as node_modules.
- Dist is manually generated using the instructions found in the resume repo to use a downloaded font, and ignored.
